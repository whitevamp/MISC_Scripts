# File Mover/Copy to Multiple Subdirectories

This Python script provides a user interface (UI) to move or copy multiple files from a source folder into a set of subdirectories in a destination folder. It is useful for distributing files one by one across multiple subdirectories. Additionally, the script can also copy or move a single file into each subdirectory based on a user-specified path.

## Features
- Move or copy files from a source directory to subdirectories within a destination folder.
- Automatically detects the number of files in the source folder or allows the user to manually specify the number of files.
- Supports customizing the destination subdirectory structure with a top-level directory (TLD) and a subfolder path.
- Option to move files instead of copying them.
- Option to copy or move a single file into a specific subfolder of each subdirectory.
- Error handling for missing folders and incorrect inputs.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (pre-installed with Python on most systems)
- `shutil` (part of Python's standard library)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/file-mover-copy.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the script directory:
   ```bash
   cd file-mover-copy
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python3 v3.py
   ```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Source Folder**: Select the source folder containing the files you want to move or copy.
2. **Destination Folder**: Select the destination folder where the subdirectories are located.
3. **Top-Level Directory (TLD) Name**: Specify the TLD name that will change for each file (e.g., `Replacer 1`, `Replacer 2`, etc.).
4. **Subfolder Path**: Enter the path inside each subdirectory where the files should be placed (e.g., `textures/interface/objects`).
5. **File Count**:
    - By default, the script auto-detects the number of files in the source folder.
    - Uncheck the "Auto-detect number of files" checkbox if you want to manually specify the number of files to process.
6. **Move or Copy**: Select whether to move or copy the files by checking the box "Move files instead of copy."
7. **Optional Single File Copy**:
    - Check the "Also copy a single file to all subdirectories" checkbox to copy or move a specific file into all subdirectories.
    - After checking the box, you'll be prompted to select the file and specify the destination subfolder (e.g., `meshes/interface/logo`).

8. Click the **Start** button to begin moving or copying the files.

### Example Scenario

1. **Source Folder**: `/path/to/source/`
   - Contains files: `file1`, `file2`, `file3`
2. **Destination Folder**: `/path/to/destination/`
   - Subdirectories:
     - `Replacer 1/textures/interface/objects`
     - `Replacer 2/textures/interface/objects`
     - `Replacer 3/textures/interface/objects`
3. **Output**: 
   - `file1` is placed in `Replacer 1/textures/interface/objects/`
   - `file2` is placed in `Replacer 2/textures/interface/objects/`
   - `file3` is placed in `Replacer 3/textures/interface/objects/`

### Optional Single File Example

If you select the option to copy a single file to a specific subfolder, and specify:
- **Source File**: `/path/to/single/file`
- **Destination Subfolder**: `meshes/interface/logo`

The single file will be copied to:
- `Replacer 1/meshes/interface/logo/`
- `Replacer 2/meshes/interface/logo/`
- `Replacer 3/meshes/interface/logo/`

## Error Handling
- If any required folder or file path is missing, an error message will be displayed.
- Ensure that all directories specified in the subfolder paths exist, as the script will not create new subdirectories.
