Perfect name choice — `CS2DecalBuilder.py` is clear, on-brand, and great for discoverability on GitHub or modding sites. Here's a clean, well-structured `README.md` file for your repo:

# 🎨 CS2DecalBuilder

A GUI-based Python tool for converting and preparing custom image decals for use in **Cities: Skylines II** mods. Easily convert your PNG/JPG files into properly structured decal assets with adjusted metadata and folder structure.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Simple **Tkinter GUI** with text input + file/folder browser support  
- ✅ Converts JPG/JPEG to PNG (with proper transparency and resizing)  
- ✅ Adjusts mesh size values in a template JSON based on image dimensions  
- ✅ Renames and structures output folders/files automatically  
- ✅ Places image and decal.json in unique folders (e.g., `tree123/_BaseColorMap.png`)  
- ✅ Fully compatible with **CS2 modding requirements**  

---

## 🖥️ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) (`pip install pillow`)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone this repo** or [download the script](CS2DecalBuilder.py)

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install pillow
   ```

3. **Run the tool**:
   ```bash
   python CS2DecalBuilder.py
   ```

---

## 🧰 How To Use

1. Select your:
   - 📁 Source folder (where your image files are)
   - 📁 Destination folder (where the structured output will go)
   - 📄 Template JSON file (base decal file to modify)
   - ✍️ Prefix (used for folder naming like `tree456`)

2. Click **Start Processing**

The tool will:
- Walk through your source folder
- Convert non-PNG files to `.png`
- Resize images safely for CS2 (avoiding Unity texture errors)
- Generate mesh sizes in `decal.json` based on image resolution
- Save the image as `_BaseColorMap.png` with the updated decal file

---

## 📐 Mesh Size Calculation

Automatically determines mesh values from the texture resolution using rules like:

| Resolution       | Mesh Size Output      |
|------------------|------------------------|
| 512 x 512        | `"x": 4, "z": 4`       |
| 1024 x 1536      | `"x": 6, "z": 9`       |
| 2048 x 512       | `"x": 16, "z": 4`      |

*(Fully based on Cities: Skylines II decal size specs)*

## 🧪 Example Output

```
destination_folder/
├── tree456/
│   ├── _BaseColorMap.png
│   └── decal.json
├── tree901/
│   ├── _BaseColorMap.png
│   └── decal.json
```

---

## ❗ Troubleshooting

- **Unity errors?** This tool now pads/resizes small images to avoid "Failed to create texture" errors in-game
- **Non-square textures?** Automatically calculates ratio and adjusts mesh X/Z accordingly
