    When spawning a decal,there is also a mesh that needs to be created.
    The decal.json file houses parameters you can tweak to suit your decals needs.
    The code under "colossal_mesh" has parameters you can change according to how big you want your decal to spawn
    The parameters look like this:
    ﻿
    		        	"colossal_MeshSize": {
    x is for width	  			 "x": 4,
    y is for depth 				 "y": 1,
    z is for heigth  		    	 "z": 4,
    w is for spawn angle     		 "w": 0
    ﻿
    ﻿
    The size of your texture and how big you want your decal to spawn dictate the x and z value seen above
    !!Do not use a comma to specify decimals as this will brake the code!!
    ﻿
    ﻿
    ﻿
    Common texture sizes and there respective ratio's with certain meshsizes:
    ﻿
    L 512  x H 512 	= 1 x 1  	 chosen mesh size of 2 =    "x": 2 and  "z": 2 parameters
    L 1024 x H 1024	= 1 x 1  	 chosen mesh size of 4 =    "x": 4 and  "z": 4 parameters    
    L 2048 x H 2048 = 1 x 1  	 chosen mesh size of 6 =    "x": 6 and  "z": 6 parameters
    ﻿
    L 512 x H 1024 	= 1 x 2  	 chosen mesh size of 4 =    "x": 4 and  "z": 8 parameters
    L 512 x H 1536 	= 1 x 3  	 chosen mesh size of 4 =    "x": 4 and  "z": 12 parameters
    L 512 x H 2024 	= 1 x 4  	 chosen mesh size of 4 =    "x": 4 and  "z": 16 parameters
    ﻿
    L 1024 x H 512 	= 2 x 1  	 chosen mesh size of 4 =    "x": 8 and  "z": 4 parameters
    L 1536 x H 512 	= 3 x 1   	 chosen mesh size of 4 =    "x": 12 and  "z": 4 parameters
    L 2048 x H 512  = 4 x 1  	 chosen mesh size of 4 =    "x": 16 and  "z": 4 parameters 
    ﻿
    L 1024 x H 1536	= 1 x 1.5  	 chosen mesh size of 6 =    "x": 6 and  "z": 9 parameters
    L 2048 x H 1536 = 2 x 1.5        chosen mesh size of 6 =    "x": 12 and  "z": 9 parameters
    ﻿
    L 1536 x H 1024	= 1.5 x 1        chosen mesh size of 6 =    "x": 9 and  "z": 12 parameters 
    L 1536 x H 2048 = 1.5 x 2        chosen mesh size of 6 =    "x": 12 and  "z": 9 parameters
    ﻿

    If you choose a different meshsize just adjust it according to the ratio like the examples below
    ﻿
    Examples:
    ﻿
    If your decal is 512x512 "x": 2 and "z": 2 might be enough,but if you want it to be bigger use "x": 6 and "z": 6 for example
    This will stretch your decal out though,so with bigger numbers you need bigger textures
    If your decal is 512x512 and you want your meshsize to be 4
    The ratio is 1:1  and x is 4 and z is 4
    ﻿
    ﻿
    If your decal is 1024x512 and your meshsize is 4, you need to adjust the x value to be twice as big as the z value
    The ratio is 2:1  and x is 8 and z is 4
    ﻿
    ﻿
    If your decal is L 2048x1536 and the meshsize is 4, you need to adjust the z value to be 1.5 as big as the x value
    The ratio is 2:1.5 and x is 4 and z is 3 
    ﻿

    I hope this all makes sense, its a bit technical but you should manage fine
    Any questions i will answer in the comments
