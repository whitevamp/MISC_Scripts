# Random File Copier and Program Launcher

This batch script is designed to randomly select a file from a source directory, delete all files in the destination directory, copy the selected file to the destination directory, and then launch a specified program. It includes error checking to ensure the operations are completed successfully.

## Features

- Randomly selects one file from the source directory.
- Deletes all files in the destination directory before copying.
- Automatically overwrites any files in the destination folder with the newly copied file.
- Launches a specified program after the file copy operation is complete.

## Requirements

- Windows operating system (the script uses Windows command-line commands).

## Usage

### 1. Clone or Download the Script

Download the `random_file_copy.bat` file to your machine.

### 2. Configure the Script

Before running the script, open the `.bat` file in a text editor and modify the following variables to fit your needs:

```batch
set "source_dir=C:\path\to\source\folder"
set "dest_dir=C:\path\to\destination\folder"
start "" "C:\path\to\your\program.exe"
```

- `source_dir`: Path to the folder containing the files you want to randomly copy.
- `dest_dir`: Path to the destination folder where the randomly selected file will be copied.
- `start "" "C:\path\to\your\program.exe"`: Path to the program you want to run after the file has been copied.

### 3. Run the Script

1. Double-click the batch file (`random_file_copy.bat`) or run it via the command line.
   
   Example:
   ```bash
   random_file_copy.bat
   ```

2. The script will:
   - Delete all files in the destination directory.
   - Randomly select a file from the source directory.
   - Copy the selected file to the destination directory.
   - Launch the specified program.

### Example

Suppose your folder structure looks like this:

#### Source Directory (`C:\source_files`)
```
file1.txt
file2.txt
file3.txt
```

#### Destination Directory (`C:\destination_folder`)
```
(empty)
```

After running the script, it will randomly select one file (e.g., `file2.txt`), delete any existing files in the destination folder, copy `file2.txt` to the destination, and then start the specified program.

### Notes

- If no files are in the source directory, the script will exit without copying any files.
- Make sure that the destination directory exists. If it does not, the script will fail to copy files.

## Error Handling

The script includes basic error handling:
- If file deletion fails, the script will exit and display an error message.
- If the file copy operation fails, it will exit and display an error message.

## License

This script is free to use and modify. No warranties or guarantees are provided.

### How to Use:

1. **Download/Clone**: Get the script onto your local machine.
2. **Edit**: Modify the `source_dir`, `dest_dir`, and the program path in the script as per your needs.
3. **Run**: Execute the `.bat` file by double-clicking it, or running it through the command line.
